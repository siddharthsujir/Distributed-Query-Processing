Join Using Hadoop MapReduce
------------------------------


Assumptions
--------------

The following assumptions have been made
1) HAdoop has been started
2) Input file has been loaded into hdfs
3) Only a single file is given as input


Files
-------

The folder consists of 3 files 
1) Join.java -Main class
2) JoinMapper.java
3) JoinReducer.java
4) Jar file which I have generated (for your convenience)


Steps To run the program
-------------------------

1) Load the project file (Join) into Netbeans/Eclipse
2) Clean and Build the project
3) The jar that has been generated will be used for running in the hadoop terminal

in the terminal go to hadoop folder and use the following command

bin/hadoop jar "NAME OF THE JAR GENERATED" "input file path- HDFS path" "outputput FILE PATH"

Example
---------
bin/hadoop jar /home/system/NetBeansProjects/WordCount/dist/Join.jar hdfs://master:54310/hadoopassignment/JoinInput hdfs://master:54310/output15

the output wll be generated in HDFS
